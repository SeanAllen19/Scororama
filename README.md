# Interactive MERN Stack Single-Page Application

  ## Description 
In this project, out group will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating our first collaborative MERN-stack single-page application, we'll combine a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. YWe will continue to build on the agile development methodologies youâ€™ve used throughout this course. These include storing our project code in GitHub, managing our work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.
